**Overview:** The Glow Company's marketing tema wanted to analyze sales and customer data from 1970 to 1984 to uncover insights into product performance, customer preferences, and sales patterns. The project’s goal was to support informed decision-making in marketing and inventory management by identifying key factors influencing product success and customer engagement.

**Data:** The dataset includes customer reviews, product sales, and feedback data, encompassing various product attributes such as category, promotional channels (e.g., Sephora-exclusive, online-only), and customer engagement metrics. The data spans over a decade, providing a comprehensive view of trends and changes in customer behavior and product performance.
- product_indo.csv: The original dataset containing information on over 8,000 beauty products from the Sephora online store, including product and brand names, prices, ingredients, ratings, and other attributes.
- reviews_0-250.csv, reviews_250-500.csv, reviews_500-750.csv, reviews_750-1250.csv, and reviews_1250-end.csv: These files contain user reviews (approximately 1 million reviews on over 2,000 products) from the Skincare category, including details on user appearances and ratings from other users.
- product_clean.csv: A cleaned version of the product information dataset.
- review_clean.csv: A cleaned version of the user review dataset.

**Methods:**
- **R:** Used for data cleaning and enrichment to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **SQL:** Utilized for querying the product, review, and sales data to extract relevant insights.
- **Power BI:** Employed to create interactive dashboards, enabling visualization of product performance, customer segmentation, and sales trends.

- **Customer Preferences:** Skincare categories, particularly moisturizers, treatments, and cleansers, led in sales and showed the highest levels of customer engagement.

**Model Evaluation Results:**
- The analysis of different product categories and channels provided actionable insights into the revenue contribution and effectiveness of promotional strategies, highlighting the impact of Sephora-exclusive and online-only channels on sales.
